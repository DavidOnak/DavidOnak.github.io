      <h2>Professional Projects</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Competed in a global challenge called IEEEXtreme 13.0 and tasked with optimizing the processing speed on the “Lexical Addition” and “Minimum Permutation” challenges in a 24-hour window. Led a team under pressure to research innovative methods and creatively use Java to solve complex problems on topics beyond what was encountered in class; placed in the top 35% in the world.
          </li>
          <li>Constructed hardware and python code for operating a robot in a student team tasked with creating a robot that can follow a black line path with gaps and turns up to 90 degrees, then stop when complete. Having a sever built, I was able to interface the robot so it can be controlled by an app we made on the phone and take photos which are updated onto the phone.</li>
          <li>Led a student team tasked with obtaining environmental readings 50 feet above ground; combined a drone with a gimbal (to capture photographs) and a 3D Printed Component that secured multiple sensors as well as an Arduino. Programmed the Arduino in C to read the sensors and subsequently deposit data onto a micro USB; connected the Arduino to the sensors by soldering wires to a breadboard.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Leveraged theory learned in class to create a battle simulator game in Java, whereby basic moves can be selected, advanced moves can be unlocked, and continuous battles can be initiated. With GUI (Graphical User Interface) and text files for saves, moves can be manipulated and the player can interface with battles against different Pokémon using similar mechanics as the actual Pokémon games.</li>
          <li>Built a program that can manipulate images using C++ code to represent a PNG and its pixels. Modifying these instances of pixels allows for the program to do filter effects such as grayscale or adding a watermark. Pixilated or painted effects are achieved by the program representing a PNG as a binary tree of pixels and pruning it.</li>
          <li>Created a RISC capable of storing 8 numbers and completing mathematical operations with instructions being fed from a RAM module, written in Verilog. Hardware code was uploaded onto an FPGA board where switch inputs produced outputs on an LED display that were displaced based on the assembly instructions stored on the RAM</li>
